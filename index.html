            <h3>Traveler and musician</h3>
            <p>I am the world chap that I believe. Travelling is a part of education. By traveling we can be familiar
                with
                the home and abroad. Many of us want to travel to exciting places and meet our new friends. Some
                travelings
                are expensive while some are cheap. Leaving our place when we go on traveling, we can see the golden
                apples
                growing. There below another sky parrot islands anchored lie. And the music: Music is made by musicians
                who
                organise various sounds and blend rhythm, harmony and melody in a pattern which makes it pleasing to
                hear.
                It is possible that prehistoric people may have chanted sounds to make music but some of the most,
                ancient,
                musical instruments were flutes, pipes and lutes which were played by the Sumerians. Today composers
                write
                music by using musical notation codes, these codes were first used by monks in the 9th century for holy
                songs and as time went by they developed into the notes, we use today, by the kith century. </p>

                <p>If you’re considering a career in web development, you’ll no doubt want to know what’s it really like
                    once you land that first role? To provide some real-life insight, we asked our in-house web
                    developer Sam to talk us through his typical working day.Having originally trained as a musician,
                    Sam decided to make the switch to web development.</p>
